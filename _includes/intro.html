      Hi, I’m Themistoklis Nikas. I’m a third-year CS PhD student at Boston University, where I work with
      <a href="https://aaronmueller.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Professor Aaron Mueller</a>.
      My research focuses on mechanistic interpretability of large language models (LLMs). I’m interested in how LLMs represent
      uncertainty and how that connects to confidence and calibration.

      Before Boston University, I earned an integrated Master’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Ioannina,
      where I worked with
      <a href="https://www.cs.uoi.gr/~tsap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Professor Panayiotis Tsaparas</a>
      on link analysis algorithms.
